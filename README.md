# ZebraLoader

ZebraLoader is a minimalistic bootloader program designed to
initialize the system and load a kernel.

## Vim-like command mode

The Vim-like command mode is 
accessible by pressing the `:` key, similar to how 
it is used in the Vim editor. In this mode, users 
can execute various commands to 
perform specific actions. 
The available commands include:

- `q`: Shutdown.
- `reboot`: Reboots the system.
- `boot`: Boots the system.

In addition, if you wish to cancel the command, you can simply press the `ESC` key.
